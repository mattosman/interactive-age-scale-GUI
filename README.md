# Interactive Age Scale GUI

This code base allows one to interactively date a firn or ice core using its depth-resolved geochemistry.  This is done by aligning peaks and troughs via the core's seasonal chemistry.

To run, download, open the "interactive_age_scale_GUI" folder in the MATLAB Current Folder, and run "interactive_age_scale_GUI" in the Command Window.  

For instructions & worked examples of how to use the GUI, please refer to the "User's Guide for the Interactive Age Scale GUI" pdf file.  An example dataset from the GC15 ice core (Greenland), as discussed in Osman et al. (2019), is also provided.  These associated data can be be found the files "GC15_absolute_ties.xlsx" and "GC15_discrete_chem.xlsx".

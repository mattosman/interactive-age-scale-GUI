# Interactive Age Scale GUI

This code base allows one to interactively date an ice core's using its depth-resolved geochemistry.  To run, download, open the "interactive_age_scale_GUI" folder in the MATLAB Current Folder, and run "interactive_age_scale_GUI" in the Command Window.  

For instructions & worked examples of how to use the GUI, please refer to the "User's Guide for the Interactive Age Scale GUI" pdf file.  An example dataset from the GC15 ice core (Greenland), as discussed in Osman et al. (2019), is also provided.  These associated data can be be found the files "GC15_absolute_ties.xlsx" and "GC15_discrete_chem.xlsx".
